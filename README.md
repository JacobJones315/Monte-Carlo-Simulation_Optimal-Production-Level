# Monte Carlo Simulation - Optimal Production Level 
* Created a program simulation written in Python that will generate a recommendation given a set of parameters
* Parameters: unit price, retail price, cost of disposing, and number of units to manufacture

## Function Objectives
* Specify if its normal (Gaussian) or uniform distribution
* Randomly generate demand instances
* Compute the profit for a given demand and store it in a list
* Compute mean profit
* Identify the optimal level of production
